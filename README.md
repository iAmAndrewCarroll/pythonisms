# Lab 42 - Pythonisms

This project demonstrates various Pythonic language features and concepts. The goal of this lab is to showcase the elegant features of Python and how they can be leveraged to simplify code and improve readability.

## File Structure

The project is organized into different components, each highlighting a specific Pythonic concept.

- `main.py`: Entry point of the program. Demonstrates the usage of different Pythonic features.
- `my_collections/`: Contains a custom collection class that supports iteration and indexing.
- `decorators/`: Includes a decorator to measure execution time of functions.
- `dunder_methods/`: Contains a class showcasing dunder (magic) methods for custom behavior.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for each component.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd pythonisms_lab

### Run

    python main.py

### Pytest

    pytest

## Components

### Custom Collection (`my_collections/the_collection.py`)

This component showcases the usage of iterators and generators in Python. The `TheCollection` class allows iteration and indexing similar to a standard list.

### Decorators (`decorators/time_decor.py`)

Demonstrates how decorators can be used to enhance the functionality of functions. The `time_decor` decorator measures the execution time of functions.

### Dunder Methods (`dunder_methods/point.py`)

Illustrates the implementation of dunder (magic) methods. The `Point` class defines custom behavior for equality and truthiness.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests have been created to ensure the functionality of each component. You can find the test files in the `tests/` directory.

## Conclusion

This Pythonisms lab project provides hands-on experience with various Pythonic features, enhancing your understanding of Python's elegance and power. Explore the code, experiment with different concepts, and continue to build your Python skills!
